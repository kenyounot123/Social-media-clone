# Social Media Clone
Created a social media site consisting of the core user functionalities of any social media apps such as Facebook, Twitter, threads, etc.
Users must sign in to access the site and can even sign in through Github. Once signed in, a confirmation email will be sent to the user. Users can create posts (using texts and images), like posts, comment on posts, as well as send follow requests to other users. 
Some of its major functions are shown below.
